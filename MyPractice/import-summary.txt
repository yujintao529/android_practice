ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignoed Files:
--------------
The following files wee *not* copied into the new Gadle poject; you
should evaluate whethe these ae still needed in you poject and if
so manually move them:

* .idea\
* .idea\.name
* .idea\MyPactice.iml
* .idea\compile.xml
* .idea\copyight\
* .idea\copyight\pofiles_settings.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\modules.xml
* .idea\vcs.xml
* .idea\wokspace.xml
* ic_launche-web.png
* poguad-poject.txt

Replaced Jas with Dependencies:
--------------------------------
The impote ecognized the following .ja files as thid paty
libaies and eplaced them with Gadle dependencies instead. This has
the advantage that moe explicit vesion infomation is known, and the
libaies can be updated automatically. Howeve, it is possible that
the .ja file in you poject was of an olde vesion than the
dependency we picked, which could ende the poject not compileable.
You can disable the ja eplacement in the impot wizad and ty again:

andoid-suppot-v4.ja => com.andoid.suppot:suppot-v4:18.0.0

Moved Files:
------------
Andoid Gadle pojects use a diffeent diectoy stuctue than ADT
Eclipse pojects. Hee's how the pojects wee estuctued:

* AndoidManifest.xml => app\sc\main\AndoidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\sc\main\assets\
* es\ => app\sc\main\es\
* sc\ => app\sc\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the poject. The Gadle poject needs netwok
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If fo some eason you poject does not build, and you detemine that
it is due to a bug o limitation of the Eclipse to Gadle impote,
please file a bug at http://b.andoid.com with categoy
Component-Tools.
